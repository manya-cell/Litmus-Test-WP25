## setup and general stuffs 

- In your machine learning and data science journey, you will mostly be using python as your language. For a code editor, VS code is a good starting option, so set it up. [setup instructions](https://youtu.be/mpk4Q5feWaw?si=610Wjb7jsQlKi-gX)
- For any kind of errors or issues during setup (or in general coding), make sure to roam on the internet (especially stack exchange) before asking any mentors about it.
- Make yourself familiar with `git` and `github` as you proceed with collaborative development. [basic commands](https://youtu.be/rE2zRhZdjFU?si=A-V2hjahIymqJrj6)
- In case of any technical challenges or doubts, raise an issue on this github repository itself. stuck ?? refer to [this](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue)
- All your assignment submissions will be on this repository itself through pull requests. Can't figure out how to do ?? refer to [this](https://share.google/eE9w6r1hbWVMGYfE6)
